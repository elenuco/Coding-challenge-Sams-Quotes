# Coding-challenge-Sams-Quotes
QA Checking Login

You are helping Sam, a fan of quotes by famous people. She built his website, https://quotes.toscrape.com/, and he needs you to help him test the login functionality.

Task at hand

Automated task: Create an automated Selenium Test in Java to validate that we can login successfully using the user: admin, and psw: admin.

Do a challenge that reflects your thinking and decision making skills so we can understand your seniority. Don’t replace yourself with AI, we want to work with human engineers. We aren’t looking for perfect, we are looking to understand how you think.

How to submit your challenge

Beware, during your interview we will ask to explain your code and make changes to it live.

1. Upload your code to a repo.
2. Record a 5 minute video showcasing your work (jam.dev, loom, etc...).
